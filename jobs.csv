Life at Abridge

At Abridge, we're driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the ""inverse"" way in a legacy system-focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate.

Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds-an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it's holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and helping each other be successful.
Diversity & Inclusion

Abridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do. We actively welcome applicants from all backgrounds (including but not limited to race, gender, educational background, and sexual orientation).

At Saildrone, we sustainably explore, map, and monitor the oceans to understand, protect, and preserve our world. We provide real\\-time access to critical data from any ocean on earth, 24/7/365, and use proprietary software applications to transform that data into actionable insights and intelligence. Our fleet of uncrewed surface vehicles (USVs), powered by renewable wind and solar power, have a minimal carbon footprint and operate without the need for a crewed support vessel.


Saildrone works with governments, civil agencies, foundations, universities, and private companies around the globe to drive better information about our oceans and seas—from sailing into the eye of a category 4 hurricane to obtain new data about how storms intensify, collecting new CO2 data in hard\\-to\\-reach areas, and counting fish biomass to inform sustainable fishery management, to mapping the ocean floor and reducing illegal fishing and drug trafficking. As a result of our work, we have been included on TIME's List of the 100 Most Influential Companies in 2024, Fast Company’s list of the ""World’s Most Innovative Companies for 2022,"" and earned the Ocean Awards’ Innovation Award, presented by the Blue Marine Foundation. Saildrone's hurricane mission was included as one of The New York Times' ""Top 21 Things that happened (for the first time) in 2021"" and Popular Science's ""100 Greatest Innovations of 2021,"" and entered into the Guinness Book of World Records for recording the ""highest windspeed recorded by a USV.""


We are based in Alameda, CA, with offices in Washington DC and St. Petersburg, FL, and operate our missions worldwide. Saildrone is backed by top\\-tier investors in the frontier tech and sustainability sectors, including Social Capital, Capricorn, Lux Capital, BOND Capital, and Emerson Collective.

 **The Role**


Saildrone uses an onboard perception system for ocean monitoring and navigational safety. Using a combination of machine vision, radar, acoustic and AIS data, our worldwide fleet of drones perceives the world in real\\-time to combat illegal fishing and safely sail through crowded seas. Ocean\\-going drones present a unique challenge for high\\-performance perception: our fleet is solar and wind powered, and can be deployed for up to one year without returning to port. These challenges make efficient algorithms a must and require thoughtful over\\-the\\-air deployment strategies. We’re looking for a top\\-notch Staff Perception Engineer to help drive projects within the Perception Team taking on these unique challenges.


As a Staff Perception Engineer at Saildrone, you will not only bring technical expertise but also serve as a key technical leader within the Perception Team. Being a technical leader means driving the team towards innovative solutions, fostering a collaborative environment, and setting a high standard for technical excellence. You will be responsible for guiding cross\\-functional project teams through complex challenges, making critical technical decisions, and ensuring that the team's output meets Saildrone's rigorous quality and performance standards. Your role will involve mentoring junior engineers, facilitating knowledge sharing, and leading by example in writing efficient, high\\-quality code. By embodying technical leadership, you will empower your teammates to excel, drive the team’s success, and contribute significantly to Saildrone's mission of enhancing ocean monitoring and navigational safety through cutting\\-edge perception systems.
